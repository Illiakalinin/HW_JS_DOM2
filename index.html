      <p class="news">As part of the experimental features in Minecraft Bedrock version 1.18.10, Mojang has revealed
        some of the
        abilities of the frog mobs coming in this year's Wild Update. They can eat small Slimes and small Magma Cubes,
        which is a goofy enough habit. As Mojang shared during today's Minecraft Live presentation, frogs had a brief
        period as apex predators capable of swallowing entire goats. Players started noticing this savage frog
        behavior in the beta version of Minecraft for Windows back in January. Their hunger was, as some players
        realized, insatiable.
